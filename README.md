This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I was born and grew up Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I am currently attending the University of Iowa and planning to graduate with BBA in Finance and business analytics. I also work as a supervisor for the campus's recreational services. I am motivated by family, friends, and co-workers, or just any one who pushes me to reach my goals. I love to volunteer when the opportunity presents itself. I also love cheering on the hawkeyes any chance I get!
